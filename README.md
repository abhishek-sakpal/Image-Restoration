# Image Restoration Project

## Overview
This project aims to restore blurry or damaged images using custom-trained machine learning models. Leveraging advanced image processing techniques, we implemented deblurring and inpainting algorithms to enhance image quality. The project utilizes TensorFlow and PyTorch for model training and evaluation.

## Features
- **Image Preprocessing**: Applied various preprocessing techniques to improve model training efficiency and accuracy.
- **Deblurring**: Implemented algorithms to remove blurriness from images.
- **Inpainting**: Developed methods to fill in missing or damaged parts of images.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessed model performance using metrics like PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) and SSIM (Structural Similarity Index).

## Performance Metrics
- **PSNR Improvement**: 25dB
- **SSIM Improvement**: 0.15

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Libraries**: NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-image
